\section{Initialize the project} \label{sec:init}

\subsection{Objectives}
This step is creating the project metadata that will be used throughout the processing. There are three main things that {\emClarity} will do. First, it will grab the sub-region coordinates in \code{/recon/<prefix>.coords}. Second, it will grab the tilt-series CTF estimate stored in \code{fixedStacks/ctf/<prefix>\_ali1\_ctf.tlt}. Lastly, it will grab the particle coordinates from \code{convmap/<prefix>\_<nb>\_<bin>.csv}. As explained in the last section, peaks can be removed from the \code{.csv} files using the corresponding \code{.mod} file.

\begin{note}Once ran, these files are ignored and will not be used again. If one needs to modify some of the above-mentioned information, this step must be re-run for the modification to be effective.
\end{note}


\subsection{Parameters}

\input{Figures_Tables/09_parameters}


\subsection{Run}

The \code{init} routine has the following signature:
\begin{lstlisting}
>> emClarity init <param>
\end{lstlisting}
where \code{<param>} is the parameter file name.

\subsection{Outputs}

The main output is of course the output file \code{<subTomoMeta>.mat}. This step should only take a few seconds to run and it will output to the terminal, the total number of particles and the number of particles before and after cleaning, for each sub-region.
